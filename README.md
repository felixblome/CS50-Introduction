## CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
This repository is a public collection of all exercises I did during the "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science" from Harvard University. 
That particular course is part of my personal interest to learn more about computer science and programming.

In my study "Game-Production & Management" we develop a video game each semester and I try to focus as much as possible 
on the technical part of programming and implementing everything into the game engine we use. Everything regarding programming and CS beyond 
that is being done in my free time.
